# IntroApp
## This Android app adds splash screen slides to make a great intro for an app.

###### Short description
Adding Welcome / Intro screens in your app is a great way of showcasing the major features of the app. You can add as many slides as you want. But too many slides can be cumbersome for the first time app users. So, try to make it as simple and intuitive as possible. In this app when the user *opens the app for the first time*, he or she is greeted with some introduction slides. Four slides to be specific. This app's slides will contain four slides each of which will contain the following information:

1. SLIDE 1  **Hello Food!**:- To let the users know that the following app can be used to order food online.
2. SLIDE 2  **Movie Tickets**:- To let the users know that the following app can be used to book movie tickets.
3. SLIDE 3  **Great Discounts**:- To let the users know that the following app can be used to get discounts from the services.
4. SLIDE 4  **World Travel**:- To let the users know that the following app can be used to book flights.
