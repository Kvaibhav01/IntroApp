###### Short description

Adding Welcome / Intro screens in your app is a great way of showcasing the
major features of the app. You can add as many slides as you want. But too many
slides can be cumbersome for the first time app users. So, try to make it as
simple and intuitive as possible. In this app when the user _opens the app for
the first time_, he or she is greeted with some introduction slides. Four slides
to be specific. This app's slides will contain four slides each of which will
contain the following information:

1. SLIDE 1 **Hello Food!**:- To let our users know that the following app can be
   used to order food online.
2. SLIDE 2 **Movie Tickets**:- To let our users know that the following app can
   be used to book movie tickets.
3. SLIDE 3 **Great Discounts**:- To let our users know that the following app
   can be used to get discounts from the services.
4. SLIDE 4 **World Travel**:- To let our users know that the following app can
   be used to book flights.
